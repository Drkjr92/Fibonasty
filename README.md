# Fibonasty

I was reading a book called "30-second Math" this morning and came across the Fibonacci numbers. So, as practice for github and coding, decided to type a program that takes a valid Fibonacci number from a user and print a list of terms all the way until that number.

/*Correct user input */ 
This program will print out a list of terms corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence. 
 Enter a valid term that belongs to the Fibonacci numbers:  

233

The list of terms is as presents:  
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233]


/* Incorrect User input */
 
 Enter a valid term that belongs to the Fibonacci numbers:  

badboy
Not an integer

This program will print out a list of terms corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence. 
 Enter a valid term that belongs to the Fibonacci numbers:  

13

The list of terms is as presents:  
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]




Happy Coding!
